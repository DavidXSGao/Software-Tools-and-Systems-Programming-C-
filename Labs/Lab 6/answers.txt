Q1: B and E are printed by both processes.  (Thanks to block buffering, if you redirect the output to a file, then A will be printed twice.)

Q2: There are 8 possible orders:  
ABDEBCE
ABCEBDE
 
ABBCDEE 
ABBDCEE 
ABBCEDE 
ABBDECE 

ABCBDEE 
ABDBCEE

Q3: 
Argument -> number of processes
2 -> 4 
3 -> 8
4 -> 16

Q4:
First parent creates 3 processes, first child creates 2 processes, children in the 3rd iteration of the loop create 1 process. 
126->127->129->144
     127->132
126->128->131
126->130
