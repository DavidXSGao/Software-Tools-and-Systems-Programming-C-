typedef - creates an alias for an existing type
macro - #define 
      - pre-processor places constant in place of var before compile
	  - if used to define function need to put parameter in brackets, otherwise order of operations matter

system calls - read(), write(), exit()
library calls - fgets(), fopen(), printf(), scanf()

One of the reasons we check the return values on system calls is that the things that can make them fail are often outside of the control of the program.
We check the return values of system calls because continuing to execute the program assuming that the system call succeeded may lead to a mysterious error later in the program execution.
errno is a global integer variable that is set when a system call fails.
When we ran a program that tried to access argv[1] and that argument wasn't provided by the user, we got a segmentation fault.
A useful technique for testing when something isn't going to fit into a buffer, is to temporarily make the buffer size small, so your tests can be small.
