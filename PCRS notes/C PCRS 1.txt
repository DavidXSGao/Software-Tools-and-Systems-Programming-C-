#include <stdio.h> - import standard input and output
\n is *1* character
%.xf - decimal places of float value

A stack frame, is a section of memory created when a function is executed, is removed when a function exits, stores variables associated with the function parameters, and variables declared in the function
A[i] The address of A + (i * size of A[0]) bytes. The address of A[0] + (i * size of a single element of A) bytes.
A has size X, set A[Y] where Y >= X, You risk writing over another variable in your program, It might appear to work perfectly fine., If you are lucky, you get an error so the mistake doesn't cause you headaches later.
